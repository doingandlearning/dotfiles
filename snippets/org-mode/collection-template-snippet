*** Describe your collection topic in one sentence
This is the "working title" of your collection. It should capture the scope and context succinctly.

*** Why is this topic important for somebody to learn?

*** What problems does it solve for the learner? What's the real world context where knowledge gained from the course could be applied? (This helps us figure out promotional angles, as well as next steps for the learner to follow.)

*** What should the learner be able to do at the end of this workshop?
The big picture goal. The "super power" they will be granted when this knowledge is absorbed. "After completing this collection, the desired end result is for learners toâ€¦"

*** What are the milestones that a student will reach as they work toward the big picture goal of this workshop?
This isn't a final list of lessons, but it is a general outline of the concepts and vocabulary your workshop will engrain in the learner's mind.

*** What could the example or demo be for this workshop?
People learn best by doing. What will they build? What are some ideas for examples? What are some real-life "production" examples that might inspire the workshop example? This is a brainstorm. Nothing is too big or too small.
